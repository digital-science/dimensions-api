# Publications volume per city 

### Goal

We want to measure the distribution of publications per EU cities, in a given year (eg 2018).

This will allow us to create a nice-looking map, where cities producing more research can be identified visually.

The same approach could be used for other geographical areas and time-spans.


### Output

See the cities_bar.html file for a visualisation of the results.
