    "### Kinds of identification\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two \"kinds\" of reviewer identification that can be performed. These are:\n",
    "1. **GLOBAL IDENTIFICATION** - Where reviewers are identified from the body of all researchers - for example, find the best reviewers for an application worldwide, or from a specific country\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example 1:** A funder is trying to find reviewers for a set of applications, but only wishes to use people they have already funded (e.g. people they already know, and do not need to worry about vetting). In that case, the body of researchers they are looking for is *all researchers who have been funded by them in the past*.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example 2:** A funder is working in partnership with a collection of universities to perform a body of research. As part of that partnership, personnel from these universities will review grant applications. In that case, the body of researchs they are looking for is *all researchers currently affiliated with any of a list of universities.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **PANEL IDENTIFICATION** - Where reviewers are identified from a list of known researchers - for example, find the best reviewers for an application from a panel of reviewers\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:** A funder has a pre-assembled body of a dozen researchers which it intends to use to review a body of a dozen applications, each of which needs three reviewers. A total of 12 x 12 x 3 = *432 assignments* need to be made. These assignments should align application topic and reviewer expertise. This is a very arduous task for a human looking at blocks of text (e.g. application abstract vs. reviewer CV) for 144 possible combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these will be described in subsections below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE** In neither of these scenarios is this utility meant to supplant the need for human work and produce a fully automated workflow. Instead, this approach is meant to assist human selection of reviewers, reducing workload by narrowing to a subset of relevant reviews. Final selections can then be made by program staff."

    "grant1_title=\"Computational design of sustainable hydrogenation systems via a novel combination of data science, optimization, and ab initio methods\"\n",
    "grant1_abstract=\"\"\"Sustainable, safe, and process-intensified hydrogenation technologies are essential for distributed, small-scale, and on-demand manufacturing of chemicals and fuels from shale gas and biomass, upgrading carbon dioxide to useful organic chemicals, and upcycling plastic waste. New technological developments in this area would contribute to increasing international competitiveness of the U.S. chemical manufacturing industries and meeting relevant U.N. goals on sustainable development. A promising chemistry to this end is catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH), a process that is carried out using hydrogen donors instead of pure molecular H2, thereby offering a safe, H2- and potentially CO2-free hydrogenation technology. A critical step towards deploying CTH is to optimally design the underlying process, a challenging task because atomic-scale information such as reaction thermodynamics, pathways, and rates have implications at the microscopic (e.g., product yield) and macroscopic levels (e.g., process economics). The research vision of this project is to develop and apply novel computational tools, in synergy with experiments, to design CTH processes by integrating information and decisions across the different size scales. In parallel with this research, the educational vision of this project is to promote computational thinking and programming literacy at various levels of STEM education. These two skills are well-recognized as being essential for the next generation of science and engineering innovators to tackle emerging grand challenges in the energy, health, and environmental spheres. This CAREER proposal specifically aims to computationally design a vapor-phase transition-metal catalyzed CTH reaction system of a model oxygenate, viz. acrolein, which is the smallest molecule having both C-C and C-O unsaturation; as such, it can be considered a model representative of biomass-derived molecules and functionalized intermediates in the chemical industry. Designing the acrolein CTH reaction system ultimately requires identifying the optimal donor-catalyst combination that maximizes the yield of a desired product, e.g., hydrogenation selectivity of acrolein to propanal versus propenol. To this end, a novel computational framework that integrates density functional theory (DFT), informatics, machine learning, and several other process systems engineering computational methods including nonlinear optimization and advanced data sampling via reinforcement and transfer learning, will be developed as part of this research to (i) build Gaussian Process surrogate models, (ii) formulate and solve coverage-cognizant microkinetic models, and (iii) solve reaction system optimization problems. This framework will allow the PI to address a critical gap in the fundamental mechanistic elucidation and multiscale design of acrolein CTH reaction systems and thereby identify the optimal donor-catalyst combination from a representative subset of donors and transition metal catalysts. A well-integrated educational program will be developed to target different age groups at Lehigh University and the broader Lehigh valley. This includes engaging high-school and undergraduate students in cutting-edge research at the intersection of data science and catalysis, developing online interactive visualization-based modules to explain high-school science and undergraduate engineering concepts via enquiry-based learning, and developing and offering an interdisciplinary elective to train chemical engineers in the burgeoning area of data science and machine learning. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\"\"\"\n",

    "grant2_title=\"Simulating catalysis: Multiscale embedding of machine learning potentials\"\n",
    "grant2_abstract=\"\"\"In the recent decades, computer simulations have become an essential part of the molecular scientist's toolbox. However, as for any computational method, molecular simulations require a compromise between speed and precision. The most precise techniques apply principles of quantum mechanics (QM) to the molecular systems and can precisely describe processes involving changes in the electronic structure, such as the breaking and forming of chemical bonds. However, they require tremendous computer resources, being prohibitively costly even for systems containing only several hundreds of atoms. On the other extreme are highly simplified \\\"Molecular Mechanics\\\" (MM) methods that ignore the quantum nature of molecules and instead describe the atoms as charged \"balls\" of certain size connected with springs representing the chemical bonds. The core limitation of MM is its inability to describe breaking/forming of chemical bonds, therefore making it unsuitable for simulating chemical reactions. This drawback motivated the invention of combined \"multiscale\" models that rely on precise but expensive QM calculations to describe the part of the simulation system where the chemical reaction takes place, while treating the rest of the system with an efficient MM method. This \"Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics\" approach (QM/MM), honoured by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2013, is now the state-of-the-art simulation technique for reactions in complex environments, such as those happening inside living organisms. Such simulations are important to understand and design catalysts, which increase the rate of chemical reactions (and can thereby reduce the amount of energy and resources required to produce molecules). However, QM/MM calculations are still only as fast as the QM method used, limiting dramatically the precision and timescale of the simulations. A completely different approach is to employ techniques from the rapidly evolving field of machine learning (ML) and construct a method that can learn and then predict the outcome of a QM calculation. Once properly trained, an ML model can provide results with QM quality, but several orders of magnitude faster. However, ML models are still significantly slower than MM ones. Therefore, a multiscale \"ML/MM\" model would still offer huge savings of computer time compared to pure ML simulations. Unfortunately, however, existing ML training schemes are only suitable for calculations in gas phase and cannot take into account the presence of an MM environment. The goal of the proposed research project is to develop a novel multiscale embedding approach that will allow the use of ML models as part of a ML/MM scheme. This will enable molecular simulations of unprecedented precision on processes with high complexity without limiting the detailed exploration of molecular conformations. To achieve this goal, we will take advantage of recent advances in machine learning and understanding of intermolecular interactions to develop a specialised ML workflow that predicts the interaction energy between the molecule described by ML and the MM environment. The workflow will be implemented as an open, publicly available software package that allows to train ML/MM models and run ML/MM molecular dynamics simulations of complex chemical processes, such as catalysed reactions. We expect this package to be readily adopted by a wide community of computational chemists working on enzymatic reactions, homo/heterogeneous catalysis and generally on processes in condensed phases, aided by specific training materials and workshops that we will provide. This will allow, for example, the development efficient computational workflows to understand and help design catalysts for more environmentally friendly production of desired molecules.\"\"\"\n",

While a global search casts a very wide net, it is possible to use additional data attached to researcher profiles in Dimensions to filter results to a less broad subset. Some examples:\n",

    "Sometimes reviewers must be identified from a specific list of researchers. This can be thought of as similar to the global search above, but attempting to identify reviewers from only a very particular subset of researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common use case though is to attempt to **rank the best reviewers** for a grant application among a preselected panel **in order to assign reviewers to grant applications**. If a body of multiple grants and review panelists are known, a \"reviewer matrix\" can be generated in order to visualize the best reviewers for each appliction, as well as any potential gaps in coverage.\n",

    "The use of panels of researchers to review grant applications is wide spread. Once a panel of researchers is identified, assignments must be made between individual researchers and individual applications. It is often the case that applications span a range of topics and subtopics, and that panelists may only have expertise in some of these areas. To conduct a fair review, it is necessary to align panelist expertise and application topic as best as possible.\n",

    "In this notebook we have shown how to use the [Dimensions Analytics API](https://www.dimensions.ai/dimensions-apis/) to identify researchers to serve as reviewers for grant funders. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two general approaches have been presented: Global Identification or Panel Identification. Regardless of whether you are doing Global Identification or Panel Identification, the final output is a list of researchers for each application. Additional outputs, like the reviewer matrix, can also be exported. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The selection of reviewers may be an interative process, and it may be desirable to try and produce different results by tuning the number of concepts used, or using a different pool of publications or grants to identify researchers. The **[Expert Identification with the Dimensions API - An Introduction\n",
    "](https://api-lab.dimensions.ai/cookbooks/7-researchers/Experts-search-introduction.html)** contains many more examples on ways to fine tune and tweak expert identification using the Dimensions Analytics API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is worth stressing that the outputs of reviewer finding are meant to be taken with a grain of salt, and are intended to be further reviewed by human eyes. Hence this whole process is intended to aid and speed up pre-existing workflows, rather than replace them entirely. \n"
