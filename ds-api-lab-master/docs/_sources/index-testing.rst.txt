Welcome to the Dimensions API Lab!
==============================================

This site contains a collection of open source `Jupyter notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_ showing how to carry out common research data analytics tasks using the `Dimensions Analytics API <https://www.dimensions.ai/dimensions-apis/>`_.

A companion `Github repository <https://github.com/digital-science/dimensions-api-lab>`_ including the source code for the notebooks is also available. The notebooks have been optimised so to work with `Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/github/digital-science/dimensions-api-lab>`_ as well. 


.. note::
  The Dimensions Analytics API is **subscription-only**, so your Dimensions account needs to be activated for this service and is subject to restrictions on use. Please get in touch to discuss the best option for you how to get access. For one-off academic research projects we can also grant free access to our APIs. `Contact us <https://www.dimensions.ai/contact-us/>`_
