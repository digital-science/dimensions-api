# Getting Started

This GitHub repository contains code samples and reusable **Jupyter notebooks** for scholarly data analytics using the [Dimensions API](https://www.dimensions.ai/dimensions-apis/).

A companion website including HTML versions of these tutorials is also available:

### What is Dimensions?

Digital Science's Dimensions is a dynamic, easy to use, linked-research data platform that re-imagines the way research can be discovered, accessed and analyzed.  Within Dimensions, users can explore the connections between grants, publications, clinical trials, patents and policy documents.

For more information, see https://www.dimensions.ai/ 

For a detailed breakdown of the Dimensions API language, see the [API documentation](https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl)


### What are Jupyter Notebooks?

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

For more information, see https://jupyter.org/


## Running the examples

If you are already familiar with Python and Jupyter, then you probably know what to do already. Download this repository and run it locally. Feel free to modify and adapt these examples so to match your project needs. 

You can also run these examples online in your browser, thanks to Binder and Gigantum. 


### Using Binder 

[mybinder.org](https://ovh.mybinder.org/) is a free service that transforms a github repository into a JupyterHub server hosting the repository's contents. Click on the link below for launching it with the Dimensions API Lab repository.
