So a publication may have N authors (stored in JSON  within the `authors` key), but only a subset of these include a `researcher_id` link. PS see also the searching for researchers section of the [API docs](https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/language.html#searching-for-researchers) for more info on this topic.\n",
    "* **Time of the affiliation**. Researchers can be affiliated to a specific GRID organization either *at the time of speaking* (now), **or** *at the time of writing* (i.e. when the article was published). The DSL uses different properties to express this fact: `current_research_org` or simply `research_orgs`. \n",
    "* **Denormalized fields**. Both the [Publication](https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/data-sources.html#publications) and [Researcher](https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/data-sources.html#researchers) sources include a `research_orgs` field. In both cases that's a *denormalized* field ie a 'shortcut version' of data primarily found in the `authors` field of publications. However, although they share the same name, the two `research_orgs` fields don't have the same meaning. \n",
    "    * In publications, `research_orgs` contains the set of all authors' affiliations for a single article. \n",

    "It turns out that there are two possible ways to extract these data, depending on whether we start our queries from Publications or from Researchers. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Starting from the Publication source**, we can first filter publications based on our constraints (eg year range `[2013-2018]` and `research_orgs=\"grid.258806.1\"` - but it could be any other query parameters); second, we would loop over all of these publications so to extract all relevant reasearchers using the `affiliation` data. \n",
    "2. **Starting from the Researcher source**, we would first filter researchers based on our constraints (eg with `research_orgs=\"grid.258806.1\"`); second, we would search for publications linked to these researchers, which have been published in the time frame `[2013-2018]`; lastly, we extract all relevant reasearchers using the `affiliation` data. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we will find out later, both approaches are perfectly valid and return the same results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first apporach is generally quicker as it has only two steps (while the second one has three). \n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world situations though, deciding which approach is best depends on the specific query filters being used and on the impact these filters have on the overall performance/speed of the data extraction. There is no fixed rule and a bit of trial & error can go a long way in helping you optimize your data extraction algorithm!"

    "\n",
    "This is usually due to a synchronization delay between Dimensions databases (e.g. publications and researchers). The differences are negligible in most cases, but in general it's enough to run same extraction again after a day or two for the problem to disappear.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### So which method should I choose?  \n",
    "\n",
    "It depends on which/how many filters are being used in order to identify a suitable results set for your research question. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The first approach is generally quicker as it has only two steps, as opposed to the second method that has three. \n",
    "* However if your initial `publications` query returns lots of results (eg for a large institution or big time frame), it may be quicker to try out method 2 instead. \n",
    "* The second approach can be handy if one wants to pre-filter researchers using one of the [ther available properties](https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/data-sources.html#researchers) (e.g. `last_grant_year`)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in general, deciding which approach is best depends on the specific query filters being used and on the impact these filters have on the overall performance/speed of the data extraction. \n",
