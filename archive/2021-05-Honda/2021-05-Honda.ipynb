    "1. What was the actual problem in Mukai-san’s search query\n",
    "    * Better not use this? à `chassis control ~2`. Also not this `(chassis Control)~2` ? only this: `“chassis control”~2`?\n",
    "    * No difference between `“chassis control”~0` and `“chassis control”` , right?\n",
    "2. Where are the data stored when they are pulled by the API and processed (e.g. creating co-occurrence networks diagrams such as: Building a concepts co-occurence network — API Lab - reusable notebooks for research data analytics - powered by Dimensions Analytics API) -> Asking since we wonder if a faster PC of advantage.\n",
    "3. Is there good way on how to create an search query ( beside „drill down“ method, which is rather common probably)\n",
    "4. Could it be possible that some Japanese databases are missing due to translation issues? Background: Assumption that Japanese researchers publish in Japanese. Lack of published publications vs. patents.\n",
    "5. Regarding translated documents:\n",
    "    * e.g. are Japanese document already translated when they are uploaded, or while searching?\n",
    "    * Is the full text translated?\n",
    "6. How patents (families) were counted? E.g. for HRE-G: “Honda (Japan)” or HRE-G?\n",
    "7. Why do I cant find some of our own patents: https://patents.google.com/patent/DE102015200215A1/pt\n",
    "8. Porsche is listed under Volkswagen but Audi is separated. Is there a reason?\n",
    "9. Why are the states only listed for the USA?\n"
