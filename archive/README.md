# Events and Demos Notebooks

This folder contains copies of notebooks used for public workshops and tutorials.

Most often, these are customized versions of the generic notebook templates, focusing on a specific institution or audience. 

**Note** 
The notebooks in this folder are archived in this folder but are not regularly tested afterwards. Please use the materials in the other folder for up to date examples and reusable templates.
